|| UR-22       || The word optimal is untestable and must be quantified ||
|| UR-1        || The word minimum is not suitable for a requirement specification. A better wording is to split it into two requirements, one indicating that it SHALL include 8, and another that indicates that the system should be designed to facilitate extention with more magazines (SHOULD). ||
