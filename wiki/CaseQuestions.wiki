 * Kaj: It looks to me that we could start putting up a list of issues grouping the questions from the customer requirements. I have tried but it did not work out as i thought..

Someone pls try....   ;-(



===Questions regarding the functions built into the system, and the use of these ===
  * How is the firing sequence to be programmed and executed (UR 12,13,14,15,20,21,22)
  * What other data/signals are handled by the system (UR   7,9, 10 ?,11 )
  * Dispensing  (UR 1,2,3
  * Internal signalling 

= High priority =
 # What is the efficiency of the PCU?
 # What is the weight of a magazine and should it be included in the total weight of the POD? (max 270kg)
 # Is it a requirement that two dispenser can fire at the same time, or is a program allowed to fire one dispenser at a time? (1 dispenser fire and then 20ms later the next dispenser fire)
 # Can we save 2 DSSs by fixing which direction has 4 magazines and which has 2, or must all Dispensers have 2 DSSs, where we for power reasons only turn one for two of the directions?
 # 

= Lower priority =
 # What are the dimensions of the magazine?
 # How many payloads do they hold?
