== Power table ==

|| *Description*     || *Sum*                  || *Total* ||
|| Continous 28VDC   || ECU + 4 x DSS          || 97W     ||
|| Continous 115VAC  ||                        || 100W    ||
|| Peak 28VDC        || 3 x Dispensing         || 378W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Maximum 28VDC     ||                        || 250W    ||
|| Maximum 115VAC    ||                        || 700W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| PCU efficiency    ||                        || 80%     ||
|| Conversion        || 1W 115VAC = 0,8W 28VDC ||         ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Continous 115VAC  || 97 / 0,8 + 100         || 221,25W ||
|| Peak 115VAC       || 378 / 0,8 + 100        || 572,5W  ||
|| Worst case 115VAC || 221,25 + 572,5         || 793,75W ||

As we "only" have 250W at 28VDC there is no way we can get 378 + 97, and we can therefore not fire all three dispensers at once. If we only fire one at a time we get 126 + 97, and that is below the 250W max.

As for the maximum of 700W at 115VAC there is a porblem as worst case is 793,75W peak as 115VAC.
