== Power table ==

|| *Description*     || *Sum*                  || *Total* ||
|| Continous 28VDC   || ECU + 4 x DSS          || 97W     ||
|| Continous 115VAC  ||                        || 100W    ||
|| Peak 28VDC        || 3 x Dispensing         || 378W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Maximum 28VDC     ||                        || 250W    ||
|| Maximum 115VAC    ||                        || 700W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| PCU efficiency    ||                        || 80%     ||
|| Conversion        || 1W 115VAC = 0,8W 28VDC ||         ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Continous 115VAC  || 97 / 0,8 + 100         || 221,25W ||
|| Peak 115VAC       || 378 / 0,8              || 472,5W  ||
|| Worst case 115VAC || 221,25 + 472,5         || 693,75W ||

As we "only" have 250W at 28VDC there is no way we can get 378 + 97, and we can therefore not fire all three dispensers at once. If we only fire one at a time we get 126 + 97, and that is below the 250W max.

As for the maximum of 700W at 115VAC we come in just under it, yet as we cannot get the required power from the PCU, it is not relevant. The power requirement at 115VAC for where we "only" fire onedispenser at a time is 126 / 0,8 + 221,35 = 378,85, hvilket er langt under de 700W max. 

== Weight ==

|| *Description* || *Weight* ||
|| Pod harness   || 20kg     ||
|| Pod structure || 175kg    ||
|| PCU           || 25kg     ||
|| ECU           || 18.2kg   ||
|| 4 x DSS       || 15kg     ||
|| 3 x Dispenser || 9kg      ||
|| Total         || 267,2kg  ||
