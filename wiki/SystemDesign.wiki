== Power table ==

|| *Description*     || *Sum*                  || *Total* ||
|| Continous 28VDC   || ECU + 4 x DSS          || 97W     ||
|| Continous 115VAC  ||                        || 100W    ||
|| Peak 28VDC        || 3 x Dispensing         || 378W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Maximum 28VDC     ||                        || 250W    ||
|| Maximum 115VAC    ||                        || 700W    ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Conversion        || 1W 115VAC = 4,1W 28VDC ||         ||
||                   ||                        ||         ||         
|| Continous 115VAC  || 97 / 4,1 + 100         || 123.66W ||
|| Peak 115VAC       || 378 / 4,1 + 100        || 192.20W ||
|| Worst case 115VAC || 123.66 + 192.20        || 315.86W ||

As we "only" have 250W at 28VDC there is no way we can get 378 + 97, and we can therefore not fire all three dispensers at once. If we only fire one at a time we get 126 + 97, and that is below the 250W max.

As for the maximum of 700W at 115VAC there is no porblem what so ever as worst case is 315.86W peak as 115VAC.

== Weight ==

|| *Description* || *Weight* ||
|| Pod harness   || 20kg     ||
|| Pod structure || 175kg    ||
|| PCU           || 25kg     ||
|| ECU           || 18.2kg   ||
|| 4 x DSS       || 15kg     ||
|| 3 x Dispenser || 9kg      ||
|| Total         || 267,2kg  ||
