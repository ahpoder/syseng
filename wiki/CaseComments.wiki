#summary Comments for the Terma case requirements

= Requirements =

== Functional requirements ==

=== UR-1 The pod shall include a minimum of eight standard magazines. ===
 * AHP: The word minimum is not suitable for a requirement specification. A better wording is to split it into two requirements, one indicating that it SHALL include 8, and another that indicates that the system should be designed to facilitate extention with more magazines (SHOULD).
 * 

=== UR-2 The pod shall be able to dispense forwards, downwards and sideways. ===

=== UR-3 Introduction of the system may not compromise the operation of the current weapon systems. ===

=== UR-5 Threats shall be transmitted to the aircraft mission computer in body frame format (relative to aircraft) for displaying purposes. ===

=== UR-6 The system shall provide the aircraft mission computer with status information and built in test results. ===

=== UR-7 The system shall interface the aircraft intercom system to provide audio cues and warnings. ===

=== UR-8 The system shall include a hardware implemented safety interlock to prevent dispensing on ground. ===

=== UR-9 The system shall be able to erase sensitive data upon input from a discrete zeroize signal from aircraft. ===

=== UR-10 The system status on individual LRU level shall be provided by cockpit unit. ===

=== UR-11 The cockpit unit shall be able to control power of dispensing system and MWS. ===

=== UR-12 The system shall comprise at least three modes, manual, semi automatic and automatic. ===

=== UR-13 Manual mode shall dispense the program selected by the pilot. ===

=== UR-14 Semi automatic shall initiate an intelligent threat response upon consent from the pilot. ===

=== UR-15 Automatic mode shall initiate an intelligent threat response without pilot interaction. ===

=== UR-16 The system shall provide a method of loading software to MWS. ===

== Performance requirements ==

=== UR-20 The system shall be able to dispense a minimum of two payloads simultaneously. ===

=== UR-21 The system shall be able to dispense an intelligent pattern of payloads programmable by customer. ===

=== UR-22 The system shall provide the optimal coverage against missile threats. Environmental requirements ===
 * AHP: The word optimal is untestable and must be quantified

=== UR-30 The pod structure shall remain intact when exposed to steady state acceleration levels of 5g fore 2.5 aft, 25g up, 11 down. ===
 * Lars: Specify a steady state acceleration level of 5g fore 2.5aft, 25g up and 11g down, but under Missile Warning System is stated that the MWS is only qualified to 4g fore 2.5aft, 22g up and 10g down. A test of an assembled system can then not be done above 4g, 22g and 10g.
 * Lars: what are meant with "fore" and "aft"
 * Kenneth: My guess is that fore and aft refer to the hooks where the pod is attached to the aircraft; one in front (fore) and one in the rear (aft)
 * Kaj: 5g is the accelleration forward (in the flight direction of the aeroplane - positive when starting) 2.5g is the deccelleration in the flight direction of the aeroplane - positive when breaking for landing. There seems to be a mess in the description of the test(a number presumably the aft accelleration is missing).

=== UR-31 The total weight of pod cannot exceed 270 kg. ===

=== UR-32 The pod shall be operational at temperatures of 95째C on outer skin and 102째C on leading edge for 25 minutes. ===

=== UR-33 The pod shall be operational at temperatures of 134째C on outer skin and 151째C on leading edge for 3 minutes. ===

== Interface requirements ==

=== UR-40 The cockpit unit shall communicate with the MWS via a MIL_STD-1553-B data bus. ===

=== UR-41 The cockpit unit shall communicate with the mission computer via a MIL-STD-1553-B data bus. ===

=== UR-42 The pod shall be mounted on the aircraft wing with standard T-hooks spaced by 13 inches. ===

=== UR-43 The power consumption of the pod shall not exceed 700W ===

=== UR-4 The pod shall be mounted on the left-hand wing. ===
