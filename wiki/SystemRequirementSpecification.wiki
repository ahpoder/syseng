#summary The System requirement specification under developement

= Introduction =

This System requirement specification (matrix) is a place to put the requirements and to keep tracability to parent requirements, documents and testing. The actual SRS can be found in subversion following the sss-did structure.

= Description of acronyms and use =

== ID ==

FR-n indicates a functional requirement with ID n.<br/>
NR-n indicates a non-functional requirement with ID n.<br/>
PR-n indicates a performance requirement with ID n.<br/>
AC-n indicates an architectual contraint with ID n.<br/>

== Completion ==

TBD: Requirement not done, awaiting completion.<br/>
TBR: Requirement done, but not reviewed within the project team.<br/>
TBS: Requirement awaiting input from customer or other.<br/>

= Input documents =

 * Terma case document v1 (subversion)
 * Terma case comments v1 (subverison)
 * Terma case questions and answers v1 (subversion)

= System Requirement Specification =

|| ID || Requirement || Trace || Test || Test method || Completion ||
|| FR-01 || The system shall not cause any cause electrostatic interference or other hardware noise affecting the existing EW systems on the plane, as specified by the F-16 EW Compatibility standard. || UR-3 || The system must be tested by an independent testing facility certified to do F-16 EW compatibility tests. || Test || TBR ||
|| FR-02 || The system shall not cause a load of more than 15% on the avionics bus at any time during operation. || UR-3 || The required update to the avionics bus is inspected to ensure that this requirement is adhered to (the Aircraft Avionics computer is Master, and the MIL-1553B is a pure Master-slave, so it has 100% control of the communication usage) || Inspection || TBR ||
